# Steam Games from 2013 to 2023

From the Sujay Kapadnis dataset I added the data on game duration from [HowLongToBeat](HowLongToBeat.com).

The following notebooks contain exploratory data analysis and the transformations I used to generate this dataset from the two original datasets:

* [Steam Games - Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/terencicp/steam-games-exploratory-data-analysis)
* [Steam Games - Data Transformation](https://www.kaggle.com/code/terencicp/steam-games-data-transformation)
